# We're bringing a new approach to quality assurance for modern software teams.

Today, more software is being built with LLMs. They're not just writing code—they're generating engaging content, designing functional interfaces, and even shaping product ideas.

As we embrace this shift, it's important to pause and ask: How can we ensure we're still launching and iterating on exceptional products that work seamlessly every time?

That's why we're rethinking quality assurance tools from the ground up—so you can continue to ship products that people love, confidently and reliably.

We're working.
